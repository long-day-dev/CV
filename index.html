    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <P>I have always been on a quest for self-improvement. In my school days, you would find me on the football field, practicing like crazy after everyone else had called it a day. At work I am known to dive headfirst into mastering product knowledge to really amp up the success of the teams I have been a part of. I firmly believe in putting in the work as the bigger the effort, the better the rewards.</P>
    <p>I am looking to change my career path with my sights set on becoming a web developer. After some deep consideration, spurred on by conversations with colleagues in the IT sector, I have come to realise that this path is suited to my strengths. I find genuine joy in creating code and solving errors through debugging. While it can be challenging, the sense of fulfillment that comes once complete is rewarding. </p>
